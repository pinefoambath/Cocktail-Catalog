(Takes a few seconds to load as this is on Heroku's free hosting plan. When an app on (free) Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn't receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep.
When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager will automatically wake up the web dyno to run the web process type. This causes a short delay for this first request, but subsequent requests will perform normally.)
